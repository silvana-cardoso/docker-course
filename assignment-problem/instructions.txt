Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!
# docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.
# docker run -p 3000:3000 [image_id]
3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.
# docoker ps
# docker stop b49740cd7712
# docker run -p 3000:3000 --name basicex  5982

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.
# docker stop c30ef3870ddc
# docker ps -a
# docker container prune
# docker images
# docker image prune
5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

# docker build . nodeserv:tagged
6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.

# docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 nodeserv:tagged
# docker ps
# docker stop 93986c48ef9c
# docker ps -a
